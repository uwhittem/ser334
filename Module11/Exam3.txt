Exam Instructions

The exam is open one note card (3x5 inches). No electronic items are allowed. Write legibly. Please use
a pen (instead of a pencil) if you have one. There are 90 points available and the exam must be completed
in 37.5 minutes. This exam has two types of questions:
Multiple choice questions: There are 50 points of multiple choice questions. An answer is selecting
one option among the choices given. Each multiple choice is worth 2 to 5 points.
Short answer questions: There are 40 points of short answer questions. A typical answer is two or
three sentences. Each short answer question is worth ~10 points.

Scenario questions: The programming questions are given near the end of the paper. They must be
answered on the question paper. There are 0 points of write-in programming questions.

CPU Scheduling [25 points]

1. Would it make sense to use a periodic scheduler for a system where new jobs are created all the time?
Explain. [5 points]
(a) Yes. Periodic schedulers use preemption to ensure that no matter how many jobs are running, all
will meet their deadlines.
(b) Yes. Periodic schedulers are meant to receive new jobs periodically.
(c) No. Periodic schedulers need to know exactly what will run in order to schedule jobs so that they
won’t miss their deadline.
(d) No. Periodic schedulers only support threads, not processes.
2. Consider the following set of processes (tuples look like process, burst size): (P0, 10), (P1, 30), (P2,

15), (P3, 5). Assume the processes arrive in this order as well. Compute the average waiting time for
First-Come First-Served. [5 points]
(a) 60/4
(b) 155/4
(c) 105/4
(d) 165/4

3. Consider the following set of processes (tuples look like process, burst size): (P0, 10), (P1, 30), (P2,
15), (P3, 5). Assume the processes arrive in this order as well. Compute the average turnaround time
for Round Robin Scheduling (use time quantum 10). [5 points]
(a) 95/4
(b) 60/4
(c) 120/4
(d) 155/4

4. In a multi-level feedback queue, why does the first queue typically use a smaller time quantum than
the later ones? (That is, what does that design choice maximize.) [10 points]


Main Memory [20 points]

5. Assume that we use a 32-bit unsigned integer to represent logical addresses, within which there are
bits for a page number and bits for an offset. Does the choice of how many bits are used for each (offset
or page number), impact the size of the logical address space? Explain. (Keep in mind that if n bits
are used for offset then 32-n will be used for page number.) [5 points]
(a) No. Regardless of n and m, the address is 32-bit which means it addresses 2^32 locations.
(b) No. The number of bits used for n and m must be the same in order to page the memory, which
means there is only one possible size of the logical address space, 2^32.
(c) Yes. If more bits are chosen for the page number (m), then there will be more pages meaning a
larger logical address space.
(d) Yes. If more bits are chosen for the offset (n), pages will need to store more data meaning a larger
logical address space.

6. Consider a system where addresses are 6-bits. Let the page offset (n) be 4. Addresses look like [pd],
where p is page number and d is page offset. What page and offset would decimal address 45 page
into? [5 points]
(a) Decimal page 14, decimal offset 3
(b) Decimal page 2, decimal offset 13
(c) Decimal page 11, decimal offset 1
(d) Decimal page 1, decimal offset 12

7. Why is having both logical and physical addresses necessary in an operating system - why are both
needed? Can’t they be the same? Explain. [10 points]


Virtual Memory [25 points]

8. Dealing with a page fault is expensive and something to avoid. In addition to carefully maintaining
our active frames, we can also avoid page faults by wisely picking which parts of a process should be
initially loaded. How might we pick which to initially load? Select the best choice from the options
given. Assume that you cannot load the entire process and you want to select the most worthwhile
pages. [5 points]
(a) Do not load anything. It is not possible to avoid page faults so it would be a waste to load pages
that are not requested.
(b) Load the header, initial code and standard libraries.
(c) Load all libraries the process uses since libraries are referenced so often.
(d) Load all static variables.

9. Consider the following reference string for page lookups: 7, 5, 9, 5, 6, 7, 9. Compute the number of
page faults that would occur with FIFO assuming 3 pages may be kept in memory. [5 points]
(a) 3
(b) 4
(c) 5
(d) 6

10. Consider the following reference string for page lookups: 7, 5, 9, 5, 6, 7, 9. Compute the number of
page faults that would occur with OPR assuming 3 pages may be kept in memory. [5 points]
(a) 3
(b) 4
(c) 5
(d) 6

11. [Silberschatz] Assume that a program has just referenced an address in virtual memory. Describe a
scenario in which a TLB miss occurs with no page fault. If no such scenario can occur, explain why.
[10 points]


Mass-Storage Structure [20 points]

12. [Silberschatz 10.10 edited] Why do SSDs often use a FCFS disk-scheduling algorithm? Justify. [5
points]
(a) FCFS is used since it can be implemented with a linked list structure.
(b) Accessing data on a SSD takes random time intervals so FCFS does just as well as any other
disk-scheduling algorithm.
(c) FCFS is used to allow keeping data in the same memory location on the SSD.
(d) Since there are no moving parts to optimize, so FCFS would be picked since it is fast and easy to
implement.

13. Consider using the SSTF disk scheduling algorithm on the cylinder blocks 19, 1, 98, 75, 92, 38, 47, 18.
How far would the disk head need to travel? Assume the disk head is initially at 25, and that the disk
has cylinders 1 to 100. [5 points]
(a) 100
(b) 121
(c) 125
(d) 133
14. What impact does HDD storage capacity have on HDD read/write speed? Say for a 2TB vs 3TB drive,
both standard 3.5” drives. Assume that the number of platters stay the same. [10 points]
